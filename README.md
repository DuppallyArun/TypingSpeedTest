Typing Speed Test Application
This is a simple Typing Speed Test application built using Java and the Swing framework. The application allows users to evaluate their typing speed and accuracy by typing a given test text within a 60-second countdown timer. After the test ends, the app provides feedback on typing speed (Words Per Minute) and accuracy.

Features:
1. Countdown Timer: A 60-second timer counts down while the user types.
2. Typing Input Area: The user types the provided test text in a dedicated input area.
3. Speed & Accuracy Calculation: After the test is completed, the app calculates the Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage based on the user's input.
4. Real-Time Feedback: The countdown timer updates every second, providing real-time progress.
5. Result Display: Once the test finishes, the app displays the WPM and accuracy as a performance result.
